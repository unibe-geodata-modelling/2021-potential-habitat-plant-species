# CHANGES IN POPULATION DISTRIBUTION OF THREATHENED PLANT SPECIES IN SWITZERLAND SINCE 1850

Author: Ivana Cervenka, Master student in Plant Ecology, Institute of PLant Sciences (IPS) University of Bern

## Introduction

Since industrialisation many species face extinction caused by anthropogenic influence, i.e. habitat loss, habitat degradation, pollution, disturbance and indirectly through climate change and shifts in species composition. In science it is an approved theory that most species extinctions are caused by human impact.

The scope of this module is to create several map animations overlaying geodata maps, historical maps and photographs with 
species occurrence records to visualize links between habitat changes and species decline. Thes maps will be uploaded and displayed on an internet webpage.

###### Fig.1: Possible display of animated geodata maps. It should also be possible to stop at a specific time step and to zoom in a certain area.

## Methods

Geodata map layers and historical maps/ photographs will be obtained by Swisstopo and the GPS coordinates of the species from InfoFlora.
